JavaScript has a lot of different functions, methods, syntax requirements, and capabilities and I struggle with memorizing all of the information and knowing what to use and when do use it. Thus far loops have been a  challenging concept and overall the JavaScript language seems to be an extremely massive pool of information. 

# How Did I Over Come Those Challenges? 

Seeing that there is seemly no end to JavaScript capabilities and the information surrounding it, I will focus more on the concepts of programming rather than trying to memorize every little minute detail. 

By Having the ability to do research on platforms like Google,YouTube, MDN docs, stackoverflow, GitHub, online courses, and reference guides. I am able to influence the outcome favorably, in reference to coding and creating programs the end-user will enjoy and by programming consistently I feel myself getting more confident in my choices in logic and more comfortable with the tools needed to get the job done.
